As part of my application to FleetCarma, I completed the following challenge. 

### Task 1 - Fix some ugly code ###

Imagine yourself working at Joke Companyâ„¢. This company has an app that gets random Chuck Norris jokes and can substitute other peoples names into the joke instead of Chuck Norris'.

I cleaned the codes, added a couple of functions to increase readiblity, and removed some unnecessary functions.

### Task 2 - Write a report ###

A report explaining some of the changes I made is submitted to FleetCarma.

### What is needed? ###
